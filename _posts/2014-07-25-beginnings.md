I'm beginning my honours course in the UWA School of Computer Science and Software Engineering this month. I'm being supervised by [Rachel Cardell-Oliver](http://people.csse.uwa.edu.au/rachel/).

I'm planning to use this blog (powered by Jekyll) as a dumping ground for my current thoughts and developments on my research. Hopefully if I can get fully immersed in it, I'll reap the rewards of that additional focus.

Currently, the area I intend to explore involves finding a low-cost way of determining occupancy in a given area. Ideally it'll involve a novel combination of sensors attached to a Raspberry Pi.

This week I'll be reading some papers in the area, and investigating the sensors available for the RPi.
