Dear John,

Thank you for wanting to buy the web site realestate.com. Here are important factors to consider when buying realestate.com:

* realestate.com is an excellent domain name as it can be branded as it is easy to remember.  

* Typically, when a company buys a keyword rich site from me, they keep their main site, and use the new one, realestate.com when marketing either with their print effort or online pay per click campaigns. The keyword rich domain is easier to remember and more compelling for a potential customer to click on when they don't recognize a series of companies they don't know - that do not offer easy to understand, or remember, domains, ie TeamJohn.com, HasbrookAndSons.com, BrownThomasMitchellJones.com, WonderGroup.com, GordonAssociatesInc.com, etc.

* Domains containing the valuable "Realestate" phrase have been unavailable for years. realestate.com has been owned for 11.8 years. Since realestate.com has been owned since 1999-03-01, there is additional value in having a domain this "seasoned" as the Google algorithm tends to give higher rankings to seasoned/established domains. Your rankings could directly benefit from the age of this domain.

* At realestate.com, the top bidders for "Realestate" bid approximately GOOGLEKEYWORDBID for their pay per click (PPC) campaigns. Furthermore, Google estimates there are approximately GOOGLEKEYWORDCOUNT PPC CLICKS (not searches) a year for this term. This gives you an idea as to how valuable this domain can be to reach your target audience.

* realestate.com is highly desirable. A search for the keyword "Realestate" at Google shows over 300,000,000 pages

* realestate.com is just a landing page but it has an astounding Google PageRank of 6. To see how astounding this is just go to http://www.mygooglepagerank.com/ and enter your domain to compare.

* realestate.com can provide you with a valuable source of traffic and credibility as it is currently is linked from  other related web sites.

* realestate.com has a great Alexa ranking of none. http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/realestate.com While upon first view that may seem like a high number, you have to realize that this site is not really a content site, yet people are visiting, as demonstrated by having an Alexa score.  To see how remarkable this is, for a one page site, just add your domain url to the end of this and compare

* The sheer marketing and massive successes of iTunes, iPod and iPad have made "i" domains a strong, recognizable presence. 

* Plus, this domain is one of the few "i" domains that actually makes sense when you say it "I Realestate."

* This is the .com version of the domain meaning  any other second class or additional extension permutation, ie .org, .net, co.uk, com.au, etc.,  will often cause confusion with those visitors as they will often just type in realestate.com instead.

* This is a "root word" domain meaning it describes an industry without any weird permutation, ie Myrealestate.com or Onlinerealestate.com.  Using any of these secondary permutations will often cause confusion with your customers who will often just type in realestate.com instead.

* realestate.com is the top level domain. The customers of other, lesser, permutations such as .org,  .net, .biz, .us etc may type the .com version in the same way that someone says my phone number is 1-866-flowers, yet the customer dials 1-800-flowers.

* A single, one-day ad in the WSJ ( $254,000 http://wsjmediakit.com/pdf/newspaper/2010_Global_rate_card_122109.pdf ), yet you own the domain outright. I use the WSJ ad as a benchmark, because any financial institution seeking to brand the term "Realestate" will undoubtedly utilize this print service, at least once.

We have owned realestate.com since 1999-03-01
