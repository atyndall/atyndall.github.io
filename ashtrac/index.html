    <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10/10 avg over 2 related projects.</p>
    <p><strong>Feedback: </strong><em>Excellent work! Great job, I would work with Asht again in a heartbeat.</em>, <em>Asht is a excellent worker! he made a few mistakes, but he always worked hard to make sure problems were corrected and everything was done to my expectations. I would absolutely work with Asht again.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Employer: </strong>diffuse via vWorker.com</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>I developed for diffuse a PHP backend for an iPhone app which would allow people to upload raw picture and video files, have then catalogued in a large database with geographical and user metadata, and then converted into a variety of different formats and sizes for different purposes.</p>
    <p>The iPhone app would post metadata and the uploaded file to a web server, which would validate the request and initially resolve the metadata, placing it in a database and uploading the file itself to Amazon S3.</p>
    <p>The encoding servers would then take over, each downloading a raw file from S3, encoding it into different formats, then uploading those encodings to S3 again, where it could be accessed however the client wished.</p>
    <p>Prominent features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scalability: As the structure diagram demonstrates, any number of encoding servers could be used to add additional processing power to the array with minimum disruption.</li>
      <li>An inexpensive toolchain: The encoding process for both pictures and video were powered by open source software (ImageMagick and ffmpeg respectively), acquired and run with zero cost.</li>
      <li>Cross-platform compatibility: With little modification, the backend could run on any platform supported by PHP, including Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.</li>
      <li>Easily extensible: with little modification, new encoding processes and logical steps can be added.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="mailmerge">Extensible Mail Merge</h2>
    <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10/10</p>
    <p><strong>Feedback: </strong><em>Fast, responsive, made unsolicited suggestions to improve my original RFP which were incorporated into the final product. Good, clean work. Hire him!</em></p>
    <p><strong>Employer: </strong>lownoisehighcontent via vWorker.com</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>This web-based mail merge interface was designed specifically to be simple to use but also highly adaptable to a power user. An infinite number of merge templates can be including (or custom written on the spot) which can include any token (replacement value) that has been installed in the system.</p>
    <p>These tokens are highly extensible; they can range from simply substituting a word or phrase, to looking up or calculating complex statistics or values. The tokens included in the client's solution could perform Google searches, look up Alexia rankings and website registration data, among other things.</p>
    <p>Prominent features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extensibility: Tokens are provided by simple plugin code that can be added or removed at will.</li>
      <li>Clean interface: The solution is designed to be highly customisable, but still easy to use.</li>
      <li>Cross-platform: Because it is a web-application, the solution can be accessed from anywhere with any operating system.</li>

    <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10/10</p>
    <p><strong>Feedback: </strong><em>Very professional job, extremely impressed with his work!</em></p>
    <p><strong>Employer: </strong>AshanPD via vWorker.com</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>This scraper is designed to have a YellowPages.com url entered into it. Once started it will then navigate through all the pages in that result listing, saving the results into a large spreadsheet compatible file. It is a web-application, but it is running within a Windows program, allowing it to be used without suitable web hosting.</p>
    <p>Prominent features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crash recovery: The scraper keeps a note of where in its scrape it is at all times, so if the program failes or crashes for any reason, when it is next run the option of resuming where the scraper stopped is presented.</li>
      <li>Cross-platform: While the program runs in a Windows environment, it can easily be ported to any platform, including the web, due to its use of the platform-independant programming language, PHP.</li>
      <li>CSV support: CSV, or Comma Seperated Values is the spreadsheet format output by the program. This format is supported by every mainstream spreadsheet program, thus not tying you into a specific platform.</li>

    <p>This form was designed to be embedded via iframe in a page of a Joomla! installation and instead of performing data storage itself, it actually interacts with an enterprise data storage web-application.

    <p>Prominent features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Backend validation with field-based feedback.</li>
      <li>Integration with third-party content and data management systems.</li>
